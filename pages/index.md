## Research Interests

I am an anthropologist interested in preindustrial populations, the history of
modern humans, and the evolution of human social life. My recent work is about
genetic diversity within and between human populations.

Some genetic markers, such as mitochondrial DNA, microsatellites, and
quantitative traits, evolve rapidly enough to have information about size and
isolation of subpopulations in the recent past. We have found evidence that our
species had only a few thousand members during the last interglacial and that
there were several subsequent demographic expansions, the earliest among the
ancestors of contemporary sub-Saharan Africans.

I have also done fieldwork with several groups in southern Africa, concentrating
on family demographic histories.

My particular interests have been the effects of infectious infertility on
population structure, consequences of preferential treatment of children by sex
for mortality and for growth and development, and the relationships among
wealth, family organization, and individual reproductive outcomes.
