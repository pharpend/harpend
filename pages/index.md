Research Interests
------------------

I am an anthropologist interested in preindustrial populations, the
history of modern humans, and the evolution of human social life. My
recent work is about genetic diversity within and between human
populations. Some genetic markers, such as mitochondrial DNA,
microsatellites, and quantitative traits, evolve rapidly enough to have
information about size and isolation of subpopulations in the recent
past. We have found evidence that our species had only a few thousand
members during the last interglacial and that there were several
subsequent demographic expansions, the earliest among the ancestors of
contemporary sub-Saharan Africans. I have also done fieldwork with
several groups in southern Africa, concentrating on family demographic
histories. My particular interests have been the effects of infectious
infertility on population structure, consequences of preferential
treatment of children by sex for mortality and for growth and
development, and the relationships among wealth, family organization,
and individual reproductive outcomes.

Additional Documents

-   Some reprints and preprints are [here.](Documents/)
-   An antique population genetic program for analyzing gene
    frequencies, popstr, is [here](/popstr/)
-   A different way to interpret a correlation coefficient is
    [here.](correlation.correct.thought.pdf) Is this well known?
-   Draft of a [manuscript](Documents/fisher-geometric-11-2011.pdf) that
    no one of us has time to polish up and submit anywhere, despite
    cajoling and threats. We would be grateful for any feedback about
    it.
